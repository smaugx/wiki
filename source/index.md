# Welcome to My Personal Wiki

This is my personal wiki site, different from my [blog](http://rebootcat.com) site, I will post some fragmented notes here.

## why wiki?

A blog is used to record a complete series of articles, but I think wiki is used to record fragmented notes which maybe not from me.

Wiki is a series of every-day notes!


## why not mature online notes?

To be honestly, I am still using Evernote when I build this wiki site.

But I think All online notes have some limitations, such as may be lost, not free...

So For programmers, it is necessary to build a personal wiki site.

## why mkdocs?
>MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the introduction below, then check the User Guide for more info.

That is from [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

I think mkdocs is very very simple, very suitable for building a personal wiki site.
